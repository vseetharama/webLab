technologies that originated in or are associated with
 the ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to 
  Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of
   India post-1947. The term also applies beyond 
    to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly 
     to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence,
     particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India'
      languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food,
      
       and customs differ from place to place within the
